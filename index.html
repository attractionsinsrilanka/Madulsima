		Some would say that you need to take off on a flight to have an experience of clouds around you how would that be if you could get that at no real cost? Just for a moment that’s not a journey of miles above the grounds but definitely it’s miles above the sea. Madulsima is a remote village in Badulla District of Uva Province. It is approximately with 2300-3400 feet above the sea level.

	<h4>How to get there</h4>
	<p>
		If you are traveling by bus you can take Colombo –  Badulla 99 route bus and from Badulla you could take the bus to Pitamaruwa from Badulla. Journey to Badulla would take approximately 7-8hours and from Badulla to Madulsima world’s end it would take approximately  3-4 hours. If you take the bus from Badulla at 7.00am to Pitamaruwa you could reach there latest by 11.00am and you could ask the conductor to drop you from the Madulsima Mini World’s end. You can get down from the 30th mile post and from there it is a walk of only 1.1kkm to the location. From that road you will find a footpath with a summer hut to your left you have to take that path to reach the world’s end. If you are for a day visit you have three hours to enjoy as the same bus will be departing from there to Badulla at around 1.00pm. if you are planning to go back on the same bus just keep the conductor informed that you will be coming back so that you wont encounter any problem if you get yourself delayed for 2-3mins.
